This is a first atempt to program in Rust language by building a really simple web server API following the oficial Rust documentation
https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-01-single-threaded.html

This code basically open the 8080 port to receive HTTP requests and reply two different HTML files contents depend on the
path (/ or /test)
